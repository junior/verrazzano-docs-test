# Preparing Applications for Verrazzano

This section describes how to prepare applications to be deployed in Verrazzano.

Add another page, before graal/etc, that talks about how to get the application
into Docker containers - WDT, operator, etc.

Also make it clearer that graal, etc., are optional. - move them down into a section
about "optimizing applications for v8o" or something like that
