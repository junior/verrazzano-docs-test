test

The Verrazzano Application Binding (vb) maps a Verrazzano Application Model to an environment. The binding defines placement of the components, environment-specific aspects of each component (such as volume mounts), and connection details for the connections defined in the model.

Adding a binding to the Verrazzano instance results in a running application: Namespaces are created in the specified clusters, components are deployed in those namespaces, and ingresses, netowrik policies, and routing rules are created in the service mesh. 

There can be zero to many bindings to every model, and a binding can refer to one model only.

### VerrazzanoApplicationBinding

This CRD is used to describe a "binding".  A binding provides environment/instance-specific
information about an application, i.e. information that would be different in each 
deployment/instance.  A good example would be credentials and URLs used to connect to a 
database.  Bindings refer to (and extend) "models" (see below).
